	<h1>Time, Space, and Complexity</h1>
	<p>The algorithm that performs the task in the smallest number of operations is considered the most efficient one in terms of the time complexity.</p>
	<p>Space complexity refers to the amount of memory an algorithm requires to run, again as a function of the size of the input. For example, an algorithm that requires additional memory to store data in an array has a space complexity of O(n), because the size of the array increases as the size of the input increases</p>
